# Predicting Sales on Black Friday Sales Data set

A retail company “ABC Private Limited” wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against 
various products of different categories. 

They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month.        

The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type, stay_in_current_city), 
product details (product_id and product category) and Total purchase_amount from last month.                                                
Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help 
them to create personalized offers for customers against different products.

## Approach
1. Apply data wrangling, exploratory data analysis & inferential statistics on the data set.
2. For modeling, apply Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor for this supervised learning problem.

## Used Packages
1. Data Wrangling and Visualization: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
2. Machine Learning: sklearn
